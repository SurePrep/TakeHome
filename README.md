## SUREPREP TAKE HOME!

**DIRECTIONS**

- **TASK**: You will be tasked with creating a *kanban* board from scratch.

- **TIME LIMIT**: 1 week

- **TECHNOLOGY**: The only requirement we have is it needs to be created with React. You are free to use any library you want.

- **DIRECTIONS**: Create a Kanban board using React and any other technologies or libraries you want to use. Follow the design we provided as closely as possible. 
There should be four columns (New Tasks, In Progress, Review & Done) and the tickets should be drag-able and drop-able. The contents inside each ticket as well as data inside the application can be hard coded. Feel free to use a boiler plate setup like create-react-app. When you have finished the the application email the link to your project where we can view it in a version control system like Github or Bitbucket. 

**PROS**
- Using React Hooks
- Including unit testing
- Having a working Prototype

**IMPORTANT**
- Upload to Bitbucket or Github (we will not view a zip file for security reasons).
- Include directions on how to run the application
